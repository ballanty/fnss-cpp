# Fast Network Simulation Setup (FNSS) - C++ library
The FNSS C++ library allows to parse XML files of topologies, traffic matrices and event schedules generated through the core FNSS library.
The parsed files are converted in C++ objects that can be used in C++-based simulators.
If you wish to use FNSS to import topologies to the ns-3 simulator, please use the ns-3 adapter instead.

## Project directory structure
The files of the C++ FNSS library are organized in the following directories.

* bin: binary code (generated by the build script)
* dist: distribution packages (generated by the build script)
* doc: API documentation (generated by the build script)
* examples: example code using the library
* lib: third party libraries
* src: source code
* test: test code

## Build
You can build the code by using `make`.

To build the source code, open the command shell and move to the directory where this README file is located. Then run:

`make`

This will compile all the code and place the binary code under the `bin` directory.

To build the documentation, run:

`make doc`

This will create HTML and Latex documentation under the `doc` directory. You need [Doxygen](www.doxygen.org/) to build it.

Finally, to build packages for distribution, run:

`make dist`

This will create zip and tar.gz packages in the `dist` directory


## How to use it
To learn how to use the library you can either look at the documentation in the `doc` subdirectory or look at some examples provided in the `examples` subdirectory.
Should you need any further information, please contact us and we'll be happy to help you.

## Requirements
The only required library not included in the C++ standard library is [RapidXML](http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/) which is already included in the `lib` directory and ready to use.
To build the documentation you need the [Doxygen](www.doxygen.org/) documentation generator.
